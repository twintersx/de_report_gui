USB collecting data during entire drive....
During drive, every disengagment time is recorded.
If the driver feels that was a disengagment to log, they can press a button within 30 seconds of the disengagment to review later.
These two times t0 (start of disengagment) and tf (when button is pressed) are saved. 
When the drive is complete, the USB drive switches from the racelogic to the mercury PC. 
When the drive is detected, the program will have a list of t0s and tfs to crop the video in different sections. 
These videos will then be displayed for review one by one, repeating and allow the safety driver to write a text desciption of each incident. 
This info is then saved on the mercury PC (uploaded to cloud?) and the thumb drive is cleared/formated. 
When the car turns off, the usb switch goes back to vbox and the cycle is ready to repeat again. 

Issue to solve... what would trigger the GUI to pop up and run? We could add a button to existing GUI... The front monitors are on last node. 

Sudocode 1/12/23:
start the video capture with opencv
Listen to disengagment ros node

if disengagment, loop over and over capturing the frame. each new frame check for the following:
1. was a button pressed from the driver (may not need just put timer on it)
2. timer of 10 seconds has passed, set DE to false or 0
3. another disengagment occurs, set DE to false or 0
if another disengagment occurs, set DE to True or 1 to start a new recording

rostopic echo /GPSDiag
Look for Longitude: and Latitude: 

rostopic echo /driver_input
will show steering angle, brake or accel pedal being pressed

rostopic echo /accel_state
shows linear/angular acceleration values. Disengagment occurs here?

What if instead of adding physical button, we add something to the touchscreen monitor?

How do we relate the html code back to python?
    Can I embed the GPS coordinates of the "marker" into the html? YES we can do that
    Do a very simple script embedding a coordinate into a marker
        use python to
